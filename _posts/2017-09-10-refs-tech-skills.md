To be a skilled specialist and competitive on market, every software developer should constantly improve technical skills and keep knowledge up to date. Below you can find the list of helpful books and videos from famous authors and well known experts.

## C++
- Scott Meyers, Effective C++, Third Edition
- Scott Meyers, Effective STL
- Scott Meyers, More Effective C++
- Scott Meyers, Effective Modern C++ (when c++11 will be used at work, not now)
- Anthony Williams, C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading

## Enterprise development
